 * In Strategy pattern, a class behavior or its algorithm can be changed at run time.
 * We create objects which represent various strategies and a context object whose
 * behavior varies as per its strategy object. The strategy object changes the
 * executing algorithm of the context object.
 * 
 * This pattern contains one abstract strategy interface and many concrete
 * strategy implementations (algorithms) of that interface.
